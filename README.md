# BioConductor RNA Seq Workflow

In this tutorial we are following this excellent tutorial by [Michael Love et al](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2019/CSAMA/materials/labs/lab-03-rnaseq/rnaseqGene_CSAMA2019.html?utm_source=perplexity#experimental-data).

Although the tutorial is great, it skips over some of the key steps that are difficult for beginners, including data acquisition.

The steps to follow are currently stored in the steps.md file.
