# BioConductor RNA Seq Workflow


## Introduction

This RNA-Seq tutorial was based on several existing tutorials, including this excellent tutorial by [Michael Love et al.](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2019/CSAMA/materials/labs/lab-03-rnaseq/rnaseqGene_CSAMA2019.html?utm_source=perplexity#experimental-data), the [Griffith lab RNA-Seq course](https://rnabio.org/course/), and [Tommy Tang's tutorials](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/downstream-of-bulk-rnaseq-read-in-salmon-output-using-tximport-and-then-deseq2/).

Although each of these tutorials are great resources, they skip over some key steps that are difficult for beginners, including data acquisition.

The step-by-step instructions to follow are currently stored in the steps.md file.

## Overview

The first step is to download the dataset and additional files needed for mapping the reads.
